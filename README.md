## Getting started

Install Marvin with `pip install marvin`

You can jump right into a conversation by running `marvin` at your command line. Provide your bot with a name or personality to customize the conversation:

```shell
marvin -n "Ford Prefect" -p "a roving researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
```
